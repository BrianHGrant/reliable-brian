Hi, welcome to my blog. 

I hope to use this space to communicate my personal and profesional journey related to the world of Site Reliablity Engineering.  

## Who am I?

I'm a software engineer, based out of Portland, OR.

I transitioned into software/infrastructure from customer service through self-taught and more formal education.

I've been working professionally in the field for over 5 years in a mixture of support, engineering, and infrastructure roles. 

Currently I am about to dive into a new role as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer for Cloud Infrastructure at Zendesk.

I am a strong advocate for Open Source technologies and data transparency in public governement as tools for building a more just and equitable society.

See the [About](/about) section for my full bio.

Thanks for reading!
